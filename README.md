# Video Summarizer
An application for automatically summarizing YouTube videos in **Markdown format**.  
The project was built for educational purposes and evolved through two main versions:
1. **[Colab notebook ‚Äì LLaMA 3.1 (quantized) + OpenAI Whisper](/notebooks/colab_video_summarizer_llama.ipynb)** ‚Äì testing transcription and summarization with a local model.
2.  **[Jupyter notebook ‚Äì GPT-4o-mini + OpenAI Whisper](/notebooks/jupyter_video_summarizer_gradio.ipynb)** - lightweight, cost-effective, and further developed as the final solution.

## Features
- Downloading audio from YouTube videos (**yt-dlp**)
- Transcribing audio with **Whisper-1**
- Generating summaries in structured **Markdown** with **GPT-4o-mini**
- Simple **Gradio** interface for testing
- Modular architecture with a dedicated **REST API (FastAPI)**
